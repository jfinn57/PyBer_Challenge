# Overview

After performing some initial analysis on a file of ride-sharing data, we were given the assignment to organize, group, and graph a specific set to submit to decision makers at PyBer. By creating a simple visual from a huge group of data, it's easier to digest and find trends depending on what the business is doing.

## Results

As we can see from our results, collected fares are much higher in Urban areas compared to Suburban and Rural. It makes sense that the more densely populated an area is, the more people are there using the ride-share service.

On top of that, it's interesting to see spikes for all types of cities in late February and a few jumps week to week in March in the Urban areas. The execs at PyBer might have more information on that, if promotions were going on during this time or if there were popular events going on in the city. This is a case where we might need some industry knowledge to explain some of the variances in data.


## Summary

For recommendations, I would first say to definitely try to provide more drivers in Urban areas with less of a focus in rural places. 

Next, it looks like that last week of February must have a holiday or event in the city. It would be smart to be prepared for that to be a busy week in the future.

Finally, if Urban areas are taken care of with drivers, it might be smart to continue to try to grow business in Suburban areas by offering promotions. It looks like it's starting to pick up a lot towards the end of April and if that trend continues it could be a solid area of growth for the company.
